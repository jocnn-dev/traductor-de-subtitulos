Now let's try something.

1
00:02.400 --> 00:09.870
What we are going to do right now is we are going to change the background of the bar and scaffold.

2
00:10.570 --> 00:15.040
If we press the dash button, the background cover will swap.

3
00:15.860 --> 00:20.210
So at the first, we're going to declare a color variable.

4
00:20.480 --> 00:24.890
Let's name it Brown and it will contain colors.

5
00:24.890 --> 00:26.240
Dot brown.
