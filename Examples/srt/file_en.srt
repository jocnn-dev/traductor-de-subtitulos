00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,570
- Let's imagine we
define a simple enum type

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,440
like we have here.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,360
I've defined an enum type called color.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,750
It has a couple of variants,

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,050
well, three, red, green, and blue.
